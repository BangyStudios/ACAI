# ACAI (Air Conditioning Artificial Intelligence)
An artificial intelligence system built for air conditioning systems aimed at minimizing power use whilst maintaining comfort.
## Features
* Controller initiation using the base API
## Features (in progress)
* Daemon and data architecture.
* Simple proportional controller to adjust set temperature for each air conditioning unit.
* Ability to configure room size/height->volume to procedurally calculate optimal airflow.
* Ability to integrate with solar systems to switch on/off given solar energy.
* Ability to integrate with solar systems to optimize temperature given solar energy.
* And more...
## Credits
* The base Airtouch API was developed by @LonePurpleWolf and will be improved as time goes by.
